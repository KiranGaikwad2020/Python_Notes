# Advanced Data Types :
○ Lists
○ Tuples
○ Sets
○ Dictionary
## Lists:
- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store
collections of data.
- Lists are created using square brackets [ ] seprated with commas
- Example:
    City = [Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Kolhapur]
- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has
index [1] etc.

## Tuples
- A tuple is an immutable ordered collection of elements.
- Tuples are used when you want to store a group of related items together but prevent modifications.
- Tuple consists of values separated by commas and enclosed within parentheses.
- Example : Data = ("Pune", MH12, "Mumbai", MH01, "Nagpur", MH30)

## Dictionary
- A dictionary is a mutable unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- It is used to store data values in a key-based format, making it easy to retrieve values quickly.
- Example: Features = {"City of Knowledge":"Pune", "City of Dreams":"Mumbai","City of oranges":"Nagpur"}

## Set
- A set is an unordered, mutable, and unindexed collection of unique elements in Python.
- Sets are commonly used for membership testing, removing duplicates, and mathematical operations like union and intersection.
- Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
- Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If duplicates are provided, Python automatically removes them.
- Example: oddnumbers = {1,3,5,7,9}
